# Data description: 

CSV file provided in the course: contains tweet data from the US presidential election 2016 concerning Republican candidates
(including user names, dates, place etc) 

# Methodology used: 

pandas and matplotlib(?)

Used environment: JupyterLab

# Issues that I ran into: 

I actually started working with a different data set in the beginning that I found online. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to work with that dataset, 
because the dataset used commas in the table as well and therefore it could not be properly read and was all over the place at times. This happenend again 
and again with datasets that I found online. This is why I in the end decided to work with a csv dataset that was provided in class.
